Xamarin Bindings for SlyceSDK
-----------------------------

These are *experimental* Xamarin bindings for the [SlyceSDK](https://docs.slyce.it). 

This repository aims to be a place where Slyce engineers and third parties can
collaborate or adding and improving bindings. Issues and Pull Requests are
welcome!

### [Slyce iOS SDK](Xamarin.iOS.Slyce) - version 5.4.0
### [Slyce Android SDK](Xamarin.Android.Slyce) - version 5.2.1


## Caveats & Future Work

The bindings projects as they stand are bare minimum wrappers to the iOS and
Android SlyceSDK. This means that although the SlyceSDK supports very similar
operations on both platforms, the C# APIs will still be very different.
Ideally, the SlyceSDK Xamarin bindings would provide a consistent, unified
API for C#, but currently this remains as future work.
